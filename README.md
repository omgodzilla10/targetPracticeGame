Download a zip of the master, unzip the targetPracticeGame-master folder, and import it
into Eclipse!

Run the DesktopLauncher.java in the targetPractice-desktop folder to launch the game.
The majority of the game code (the code we presented in class) is located in the
targetPractice-core folder.

We skipped over a lot of content in our presentation due to time constraints, so be sure
to look through the code on your own!

ALSO: Download the targetPractice extendedEdition branch to check out a super secret amazing
feature that wasn't shown in class (WARNING: may contain bugs and lack of commenting.)
